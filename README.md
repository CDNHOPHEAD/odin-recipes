//Write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)//

I am going to start coding my first website using HTML. It will include three of my favourite vegetarian recipes. Mac and Cheese (Bon Appeiti), Bon Mih (PUL) and General Tao Cauliflower.
